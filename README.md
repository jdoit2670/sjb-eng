## Fundamental Principles

The following are brief interpretations of the five fundamental principles that form the basis of the policies implemented by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB):

### Progressiveness
Progressiveness requires an open mind to understand evolving global trends for the survival of a progressive society. State governance and party mechanisms should always allow for collective decision-making. Participation, intervention, dialogue, and collective decision-making processes must be established to maintain democratic governance. Efforts should be made to adapt to evolving trends while maintaining integrity. When implementing national policies, progressiveness should be enacted by recognizing innovative social and economic trends.

### Populism
Identify and address the desires and needs of the people, taking steps to fulfill these needs by reducing social disparities. This involves acting as a political party that executes policies aimed at minimizing social inequality.

### Modernism
We live in a transformative era where society is based on knowledge. Hence, policies should strengthen modern methodologies that include public opinion and inquiry, concluding with questions that incorporate modern science and technology.

### Social Democracy
The foundation of social democracy is based on three concepts: freedom, solidarity, and justice. Within this foundation, policies should focus on protecting and promoting the following rights:
- The right to life
- The right to personal freedom
- The right to freedom of thought and expression
- The right to property ownership
- The right to act in accordance with one's conscience and to practice one's religion
- The right to equality
- The right to organization
- The right to family life
- The right to education
- The right to work

### Environmental Sustainability
- Nationalism is the feeling of belonging to a nation. It is the mental state of individuals within a geographic area who consider themselves part of the same nation.
- Nationalism emerges when there is unity and national concentration.
- Considering a nation based on ethnic foundations while developing nationalism through ethnic inclusivity.

Therefore,
- Create a Sri Lankan nation that respects the distinctive characteristics of all ethnic groups, uniting them through ethnic equality and solidarity. This is known as national unity.
